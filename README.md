INTRO
This is a recipes website made as part of The Odin Project.

I made this to extend my abilities in HTML. I aim to develop the following skills:

- lists
- images as links
- html best practices
  - accessibility
  - code structure & indenting

Thanks for checking out my projects. Feel free to drop a comment or get in touch!
