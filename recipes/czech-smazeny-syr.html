      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        I really like this dish. And that's lucky, because it's often the only
        veggie thing I can get on the menu in Czech Republic, where I live.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Czech recipe for fried cheese or smažený sýr is popular street food
        and so easy to make. It can be eaten as an appetizer with mayonnaise or
        tartar sauce for dipping or as a vegetarian main course, especially when
        tucked into a bun and accompanied by mashed potatoes and vegetables.
